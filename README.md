# CodingChallenge
Api used in the project:

API Volley:

I have used api volley because it's easy to implement, everything can be handled in 20 lines of code or so and there is no need to use any threads since it's already been taken care of.

Picasso library:

I used this library because it allows an easy image loading in the application in as much as a line of code.

To run this application, you either have to use a Virtual device, run it on your personal phone after activation the developpers mode, or you can install the apk provided in the link below
