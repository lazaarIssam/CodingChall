Api used in the project:

API Volley:

I have used api volley because it's easy to implement, everything can be handled in 20 lines of code or so and there is no need to use any threads since it's already been taken care of.

Picasso library:

I used this library because it allows an easy image loading in the application in as much as a line of code.
